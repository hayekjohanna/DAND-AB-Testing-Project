# DAND-AB-Testing-Project
This repo contains the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project entitled "A/B Testing". 

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," 
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through the notebook to help the 
company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

For this, I used statistical techniques such as Hypothesis testing and Regression Analysis to answer questions about the data 
and reported my conclusions in the notebook.

Note: The datasets I used are included in the repository.
